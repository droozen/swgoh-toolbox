This guide is about how to make the most of the fantastic tool that is
swgoh.gg.

## Setting Up An Account

To get started, navigate to swgoh.gg. In the upper right corner of the
website you should see a link to Log In. Go there and set up an account.

When signing up, swgoh will ask for your Player ID. This is found
in-game and is the most difficult part of the process, but the website
is well worth the pain.

Your Player ID can be found by touching the gear icon in the upper left
corner of the game. The ID is at the bottom of the screen. 

Some letter and number combos are extremely difficult to get correct, 
such as zero versus O or one vs capital I or lower case L. It is
helpful to take a screenshot of the Player ID and use a photo app to
zoom in; it makes the characters easier to differentiate.

When you have your account set up and you can see your collection, copy
the url (such as https://swgoh.gg/u/dretzle) and post it in Line. There
is a note in the Guild Chat that you can add the url to in a comment so
others can find your profile to provide assistance.

## Mods

The mods section of the site is extremely helpful in attempting to find
the correct mods to put on the right characters for maximum effect. On
the left hand side of your profile, select the mods link. Then use the
filters button on the upper left to filter for the mods you are looking
for. Once you understand and use this tool it is only a matter of
knowing which characters need which kinds of boosts.

Note: The mods shown on the site are only mods that are on your
characters. You may have more mods that you haven't placed on
characters that may also help you.
